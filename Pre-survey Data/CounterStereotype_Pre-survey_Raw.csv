Study ID: MOD00007185

You are being asked to participate in a research study. Researchers are required to provide a consent form to inform you about the research study, to convey that participation is voluntary and that you can stop participation at any time without loss of compensation, to explain risks and benefits of participation (including why you might or might not want to participate), and to empower you to make an informed decision. You should feel free to discuss and ask the researchers any questions you may have.  

Purpose

This study aims to investigate how certain traits are linked to certain social groups. There are no potential risks of participating in this study. You will receive course credit for your participation in this study. Further, your participation in this study may also contribute to the understanding of judgements about social groups and impression formation within the context of this task. You may end participation at any time, for whatever reason, without loss of compensation. Merely by agreeing to this consent form, you will receive full credit for participation. Keep in mind that you are not being asked whether you think some social groups, traits or behaviours are good or bad. You are simply required to report your awareness of the degree to which a given group or individual may possess certain traits. Further, the researchers are in no way endorsing the view that any particular group or individual does or does not possess a certain trait. There are no potential risks of participating in this study. You will not directly benefit from your participation in this study. However, your participation in this study may contribute to the understanding judgements about social groups within the context of this task.  

If you are under 18, you cannot be in this study without parental permission.

What You Will Be Asked To Do 

You will be asked to answer a series of questions to the best of your ability. These questions are designed to ask you to list certain traits in relation to certain social groups. Keep in mind that when referring to the social groups, you are not being asked about your personal opinions of these groups or whether you think the traits related to the groups are good or bad. You are simply required to report your awareness of the likelihood that a given group possesses a certain trait(s), and what you think are commonly held beliefs about those social groups. Further, the researchers are in no way endorsing the view that any particular group does or does not possess a certain trait. You may also be asked to make judgements about whether a certain social group possesses a certain trait. You will be asked to do this for some number of social groups. Your participation in this study will take under 60 minutes over a single session.  Keep in mind that when referring to the social groups, you are not being asked about your personal opinions of these groups or whether you think the traits related to the groups are good or bad. You are simply required to report your awareness of the degree to which a given group possesses a certain trait(s). Further, the researchers are in no way endorsing the view that any particular group does or does not possess a certain trait.    

Potential Benefits  

The only direct benefit to you is that you might gain insight into your own judgements about certain social groups and how you tend to form impressions of others. The greater benefit to psychology and society is a better understanding of impression formation and judgements about social groups within the context of this task, which can help develop interventions targeting social judgements in daily life.  

Potential Risks 

There are no foreseeable risks associated with participation in this study. You will mainly be estimating qualities of different individuals and social groups, which is a task that people do daily and without adverse effects. 

Privacy and Confidentiality  

The data for this project are being collected anonymously. Neither the researchers nor anyone else will be able to link data to you. Your responses will not be personally identifiable because a random number will be used to keep track of your responses––this number does not correspond to your name or identity in any way. Any form on which your name will appear (such as this one) cannot be matched up with any form on which you make responses during the study. Your data will be stored for approximately 5 years and might be used for future research only after removing any personally identifiable information. All responses are also confidential. No one except trained experimenters will have access to your responses and your privacy will be protected to the maximum extent allowable by law.   

Your Rights to Participate, Say No, Or Withdraw Participation is voluntary. You may choose not to participate, you may choose not to answer certain questions, or you may choose to end participation at any time, for any reason––all without loss of compensation.  

Costs and Compensation for Being in the Study 

You will receive half a research credit for every 30 minutes you spend on this study. The study will take less than 60 minutes, therefore you will receive 1 credit total.  

Alternative Options  

If you do not wish to participate in the present research to obtain the required research credits, you can contact your course instructor to inquire about alternative non-research assignments which may be done in place of research participation.  Contact Information If you have concerns or questions about this study, such as scientific issues, how to do any part of it, or to report an injury, please contact the researcher (Joseph Cesario, Ph.D.; 255 Psychology Building, East Lansing, MI 48824; email: cesario@msu.edu; phone number: 517-355-0203).
